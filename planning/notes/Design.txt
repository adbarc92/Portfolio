================ Overview ================

1. Multi-page components
	a. Navigation Header
		i. Custom Home Icon
	b. Navigation/Information Footer
	c. Drawer: left side, activated by "MoreVert" icon.
		i. Links to all other pages
		ii. Corresponding icons
	d. Triangle-maker for images
2. Individual Pages
	a. Landing
		i. The main set of links are intended to be verbs
		ii. The inset triangles (containing images) should be congruent with outer triangles and share centerpoints
	b. Play
		i. Border
		ii. React-Canvas or C++
		iii. Console should be used to output auto-battle details
		iv. After game is properly built, console should also print user input.
	c. Contact
		i. Includes: Email, Phone, GitHub, Photo
	d. Blog
	e. AboutMe: History/Timeline
		i. A summary of professionally-relevant information (skills and learning history), as well as a few recent events
	f. Projects
		i. ForEach: a project summary/analysis, screenshots
	g. #Else:
		i. Fiction
		ii. Photos & Travel
3. Animations
	a. Navigation Bar:
		i. Color: should gradually become translucent
4. Else
	a. Refactor Navigation Header to allow for desctructured imports
	b. Incorporate Handwritten Font into website.
	c. Drawer tumbles open diagonally, in accordance with the open area left by the triangles.
	d. Arrow-key Drawers: the drawer will render from the cardinal direction of the keydown; e.g. "Up Arrow" would cause the drawer to expand from screen-bottom toward screen-top.
		i. Toggle: for people who find this unintuitive; would require an "options" menu, and potentially cookies or the like.
	e. Scroll-handling: bar follows just offscreen until 50% down; upscrolling causes the bar to appear
